# Week6_The-Good_Boyz



### Requirements
- [ ] Simple web app with a node server and a database
- [ ] Your database comes with a schema, which should be documented in your readme (along with any other architectural decisions)
- [ ] Database hosted on Heroku, or locally
- [ ] Build script for your database
- [ ] Security concerns appropriately considered (you must protect against script injections!)
- [ ] Good test coverage both server- and client-side
- [ ] Content dynamic, but DOM manipulation kept to a minimum
- [ ] Mobile-first design
- [ ] Clear user journey (even if you take one of our suggested ideas, document the user journey in your readme)
