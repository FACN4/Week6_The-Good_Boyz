## Project Overview

This week's project will involve setting up a database which you connect to via a node.js server. You'll use your data to make a dynamic web app for your front-end.

### Requirements

- [x] Simple web app with a node server and a database
- [x] Your database comes with a schema, which should be documented in your readme (along with any other architectural decisions)
- [x] Database hosted on Heroku, or locally
- [x] Build script for your database
- [ ] Security concerns appropriately considered (you must protect against script injections!)
- [ ] Good test coverage both server- and client-side
- [x] Content dynamic, but DOM manipulation kept to a minimum
- [] Mobile-first design
- [x] Clear user journey (even if you take one of our suggested ideas, document the user journey in your readme)

### User Journey

A site for reviewing movies for film fans. Visitors will be able to search for any movie, read a summary of it and view the poster, and leave a review (out of 5 stars) and/or leave a comment. By default, there will be a selection of suggested films to review.
